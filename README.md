**rusty-notes** is a fast, lightweight, file-based CLI note-taking application written in **Rust**. It allows you to create, open, search, list, and delete `.note` files directly from the terminal. Designed for developers and power users, it is fully scriptable, portable, and extensible.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

As a developer, I wanted a **CLI-first note-taking tool** that:

- Uses **plain files** instead of databases  
- Works **offline** with zero dependencies  
- Can be **scripted and automated**  
- Supports **tags, search, and archiving**  
- Is fast, lightweight, and **cross-platform ready**

This tool is inspired by **`vimwiki`, `jrnl`, and `ripgrep`**, but optimized for **developer productivity in Rust**.
